Modern gives the Matomo user interface a minimalist look and feel.

The design is focused on usability and accessibility. Colours are selected to maintain a good contrast ratio. The navigation design is updated to improve focus on the main content. Support for keyboard navigation is enhanced, compared to the default Matomo interface.

Modern is maintained by usability and accessibility specialists at Whitespace agency.
